```

### Initialization

Each command is executed in the project's root where composer.json
and vendor directory placed.

Before running commands you need to create a config file. It is possible 
to use your own created file or run `init` to create new one.

The command below creates new php config file

```bash
vendor/bin/clickhouse-migrator init -f php
```   

### Configuration

There are two supporting config extensions: YAML and PHP

The config structure

```yaml
default: development

paths:
  migrations: migrations

environments:
  development:
    cluster: local
    host: localhost
    port: 8123
    database: db
    username: user
    password: pass

  staging:
    cluster: stage
    host: stage.host
    port: 8123
    database: db
    username: user
    password: pass

  production:
    cluster: production
    host: production.host
    port: 8123
    database: db
    username: user
    password: pass
```

`default` points to the environment credentials.
This property value used when `-e` is not passed

### Creating new revision

Use the `create` command to create a new revision

```bash
vendor/bin/clickhouse-migrator create RevisionName
``` 

The RevisionName is a class name, so it must be in camel case notation.
Migration file will be like `20200125120301_RevisionName`, where `20200125120301` is ID and the rest is class name.

After running the command the file `20200125120301_RevisionName.php` will be appeared in migration path

```php
<?php

use Khaydarovm\Clickhouse\Migrator\AbstractMigration;

class RevisionName extends AbstractMigration
{
    public function up()
    {
    }

    public function down()
    {
    }
}
```

`up()` method is used for migrations and `down()` for rollbacks.

Currently `rollback` and `status` are not implemented. But it will be done soon.

Initially AbstractMigration provides three methods:

- getDatabase() â€” the database name from config file
- getCluster() - the cluster name from config file
- execute(string $query) - method executes passed SQL query
